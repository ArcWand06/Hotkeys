# AHK Custom Shortcuts
This AutoHotKey script creates some custom keyboard shortcuts to make using my computer easier.  
This consists of any shortcuts I finds useful; if I think of any new ones to add, they'll get added.

### [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) must be downloaded to run these scripts
