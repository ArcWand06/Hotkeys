# AHK Custom Shortcuts
This AutoHotKey script creates some custom keyboard shortcuts to make using my computer easier.  
This consists of any shortcuts I finds useful; if I think of any new ones to add, they'll get added.

### [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) must be downloaded to run these scripts

Made on Windows 10 20H2

## How to use
Download the files, and make sure you have AutoHotkey installed. If you installed as a .zip, you should extract it. Make sure that all the .ahk files are in the same folder (they should be by default). Run `ahk_shortcuts.ahk` to activate.

If you want this to run automatically at startup, right click it in file explorer and select create shortcut. Press win+R to bring up the run prompt, and type `shell:startup`. Move the shortcut into there.
